This repository is meant for hosting code discussed in the
"Machine Learning in Geology" group at UIUC (6/8/22 - 8/3/22)


Some of the examples here will require the machine learning library PyTorch.
If you are using the anaconda python distribution it is easy to install with

conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch

You will also need to have Jupyter notebooks installed

conda install jupyter
